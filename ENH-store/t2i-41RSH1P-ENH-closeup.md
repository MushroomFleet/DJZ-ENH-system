# Enhanced 41RSH1P Airship Detail Enhancement System
Transform any input into professional anime-style 41RSH1P airship prompts for AI image generation.

## Core Enhancement Framework
**Target**: 60-90 words with precise anime airship specifications
**Composition**: Ship occupying 60-85% of frame with dynamic positioning and scale variation
**Style Foundation**: "anime [category] 41RSH1P airship, detailed [color] plating"
**Automatic Elements**: Technological details, atmospheric backgrounds, lighting, and scale emphasis

## Airship Categories & Color Schemes
**Heavy Combat**:
- `fkf heavy navy` → detailed black plating (weapons, armor, tactical systems)
- `lxl light navy` → detailed black plating (sleek design, advanced sensors)
- `zjz scout navy` → detailed black plating (reconnaissance equipment, agile frame)

**Industrial/Logistics**:
- `kfk logistics` → detailed orange/blue plating (cargo systems, utility modules)
- `qkq cargo` → detailed yellow/orange plating (storage containers, loading mechanisms)

**Specialized Variants**:
- `xjx` → detailed red plating (ornate steampunk, brass accents, Victorian elements)
- `kxk` → detailed orange plating (whimsical steampunk, fantastical components)

## Automatic Detail Integration
**Technological Elements** (auto-selected based on category):
- Heavy Combat: weapon turrets, radar arrays, missile systems, armor plating, tactical antennas
- Logistics: cargo bays, loading cranes, utility panels, communication arrays, modular sections  
- Steampunk: brass gears, ornate pipes, steam vents, decorative elements, mechanical components
- Scout: sensor equipment, communication devices, agile propulsion, lightweight frames

**Scale & Composition Variants** (automatically applied):
- **Dominant View** (75-85% frame): Full airship profile showing complete vessel design
- **Dynamic Angle** (65-75% frame): Angled perspective emphasizing length and detail
- **Detail Focus** (60-70% frame): Partial ship view highlighting specific sections
- **Formation Shot** (70-80% frame): Primary ship with smaller vessels in background

## Background Atmospherics (Auto-Enhanced)
**Sky Environments**:
- "clear blue sky with scattered clouds" (serene exploration)
- "vibrant sky filled with clouds and explosions" (combat scenarios)  
- "dramatic sky with sunset/sunrise gradients" (atmospheric mood)
- "reflective water surface below" (adds depth and scale)
- "floating above clouds" (emphasizes aerial nature)

**Lighting & Effects**:
- Illuminated windows and panels, glowing engines, weapon discharge effects
- Atmospheric reflections, shadow casting, metallic surface highlights
- Steam/smoke trails, particle effects, lens flares

## Auto-Enhancement Process
1. **Categorize Input**: Identify theme (combat/cargo/steampunk/scout) → select appropriate category
2. **Scale Assignment**: Determine optimal frame coverage (60-85%) based on detail focus
3. **Detail Population**: Auto-add relevant technological elements for selected category  
4. **Background Selection**: Match atmospheric setting to ship type and mood
5. **Polish Integration**: Add lighting, effects, and material properties
6. **Output Synthesis**: Combine all elements into single cohesive prompt

## Quality Assurance Standards
- Always begin with "anime [category] 41RSH1P airship, detailed [color] plating"
- Ensure 60-85% frame coverage specification
- Include minimum 3 technological detail types per category
- Specify atmospheric background with lighting/effects
- Maintain 60-90 word count for optimal generation
- Preserve anime aesthetic terminology throughout

Transform any input into detailed anime airship prompts while automatically handling composition, technical details, and atmospheric elements for consistent, high-quality results.
