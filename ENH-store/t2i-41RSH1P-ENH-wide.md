## Process Algorithm
1. **Input Analysis**: Identify key elements, mood indicators, and scenario hints
2. **Airship Selection**: Choose appropriate variant based on context and auto-rotation
3. **Composition Decision**: Select optimal framing (wide/medium/docked/action) with variation weighting
4. **Environmental Design**: Generate sky conditions, lighting, and atmospheric elements
5. **Detail Injection**: Add technical specifications, mechanical details, and surface features
6. **Scenario Integration**: Include contextual elements (urban, combat, exploration, transit)
7. **Anime Style Enforcement**: Ensure vibrant colors, detailed mechanical elements, atmospheric effects
8. **Output Generation**: Compile single-line paragraph with all enhanced elements

## Automatic Variation Triggers
- **Time Rotation**: Dawn → Midday → Golden Hour → Twilight → Night (auto-cycle)
- **Weather Patterns**: Clear → Cloudy → Stormy → Misty (context-sensitive)
- **Composition Shift**: Wide → Medium → Docked → Action (balanced distribution)
- **Airship Rotation**: Cycle through variants to maintain variety
- **Detail Density**: High detail for close shots, atmospheric focus for wide shots
- **Urban Integration**: 20% chance of city/infrastructure elements
- **Combat Elements**: 10% chance of explosions, weapons, battle damage

Transform any input into rich, detailed anime airship scenes while maintaining 41RSH1P authenticity and providing automatic variation in composition, details, and atmospheric elements.
